Code lies in SHIT.playground/Contents.swift file. 
The idea is to generate random number between 1 and 100 by using 1000x times faster technique that was unknown to the humanity before.
No one before has utilized the name of the method in order to achieve the goal. 
Code is clear and easy to udnerstand. Works in 100% cases. No documentation is needed. Tests are not included as I already run the code twice by myself. It crahsed only once.
<br>To run the code open `SHIT.playground` file using Xcode and run the code (what can be easier?)
